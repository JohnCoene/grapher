grapher attempts to combine ease of use and customisation. One can initialise a graph from almost type of object.

There is a convenience data to generate graphs, called `make_data`, it returns a list of links and nodes.

```r
g <- make_data() # mock data

head(g)
```

## List

From a named list (`nodes` and `links`) of nodes and links, it only assumes that the latter are data.frames where the first column of the nodes data.frame contains their unique `id` and that the first two columns of the links indicate the `source` and `target` of the links.

```r
# from a list of nodes and edges
graph(g)
```

## igraph

```r
# from igraph
ig <- igraph::make_ring(10)
graph(ig)
```

## Tidygraph

```r
# from tidygraph
tbl_graph <- tidygraph::create_ring(20)
graph(tbl_graph)
```

## Gexf

```r
# from gexf
graph("http://gephi.org/datasets/LesMiserables.gexf")
```

## Dot

```r
# from dot file
fl <- system.file("example/dotfile.gv", package = "grapher")
graph(fl)
```

## Data.frame

From a single data.frame, it assumes those are links.

```r
# from single data.frame
# assumes they are links
graph(g$links)
```

Or pass the data.frame of nodes and links separately.

```r
# from data.frames
# pass only links
graph() %>% 
  graph_links(g$links, source, target)

# pass nodes and links
graph() %>% 
  graph_nodes(g$nodes, id) %>% 
  graph_links(g$links, source, target)
```
