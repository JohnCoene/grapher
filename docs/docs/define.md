Definitions are straightforward. They simply tell grapher to use a specific variable, as is, as visual aspect. grapher currently lets you define the following:

- Node color
- Node size
- Link source and target color
- Hidden links

```r
g <- make_data() # mock data

head(g$nodes)
#> # A tibble: 100 x 4
#>    id    label  size color  
#>    <chr> <chr> <dbl> <chr>  
#>  1 1     A79      13 #12a2a8
#>  2 2     S19      23 #ffbf50
#>  3 3     A79      39 #8a60b0
#>  4 4     I61      28 #6f63bb
#>  5 5     D30      17 #2ca030
#>  6 6     D82      13 #ff7f0e
#>  7 7     W75      15 #c7519c
#>  8 8     K63      22 #2ca030
#>  9 9     W75      40 #bcbd22
#> 10 10    I61      15 #c7519c
#> # â€¦ with 90 more rows
```

The data generated by `make_data` includes, amongst other variables, the column `color`. However, you might have noticed that it is never used in our visualisation unless we explicitly `scale_node_color`. Here we don't need to scale it, it's already a valid hex color. We simply want to apply it to the nodes. 

```r
graph(g) %>% 
  define_node_color(color)
```
