Definitions are straightforward. They simply tell grapher to use a specific variable, as is, as visual aspect. grapher currently lets you define the following:

- Node color
- Node size
- Link source and target color
- Hidden links

```r
g <- make_data() # mock data

head(g$nodes)
#> # A tibble: 100 x 4
#>    id    label  size color  
#>    <chr> <chr> <dbl> <chr>  
#>  1 1     U47      15 #ffaa0e
#>  2 2     Y77      39 #2ca030
#>  3 3     C3       35 #ba43b4
#>  4 4     K37      17 #78a641
#>  5 5     N14      33 #78a641
#>  6 6     A27      12 #8a60b0
#>  7 7     K37      15 #6f63bb
#>  8 8     R44      45 #6f63bb
#>  9 9     O41      24 #ffaa0e
#> 10 10    L64      39 #78a641
#> # â€¦ with 90 more rows
```

The data generated by `make_data` includes, amongst other variables, the column `color`. However, you might have noticed that it is never used in our visualisation unless we explicitly `scale_node_color`. Here we don't need to scale it, it's already a valid hex color. We simply want to apply it to the nodes. 

```r
graph(g) %>% 
  define_node_color(color)
```
