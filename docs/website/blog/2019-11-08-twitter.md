Twitter is great source of "network data", plus thanks to Michael Kearney's [rtweet package](https://github.com/ropensci/rtweet) the data is extremely easy to access.

The idea is to pull tweets on a specific topic (given a boolean search) and graph the network of retweets, this gives an idea of how conversations spread throughout Twitter. I use [graphTweets](http://graphtweets.john-coene.com/) to build the latter.

Below we pull 15,000 tweets that use the #rstats hashtag using the retweets filter to optimise the query (we're only interested in retweets).

```r
tweets <- rtweet::search_tweets("#rstats filter:retweets", n = 15000L)
```

Then I use graphTweets to build the network of retweets, including "quotes" (retweets with a comment).

```r
library(graphTweets)

net <- tweets %>% 
  gt_edges(screen_name, retweet_screen_name) %>% 
  gt_edges_bind(screen_name, quoted_screen_name) %>% 
  gt_nodes() %>% 
  gt_collect()
```

graphTweets actually returns a list of nodes and edges. After renaming "edges" to "links" we can simply pass this object straight to our initialisation function.

```r
library(grapher)

# rename
names(net) <- c("links", "nodes")

graph(net) %>% 
  graph_offline_layout(steps = 100) %>% 
  scale_node_size(n, c(10, 50)) %>% 
  hide_long_links(100) %>% 
  scale_link_color_coords()
```
