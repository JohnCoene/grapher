Mauricio Vargas' [economiccomplexity](https://pacha.hk/economiccomplexity) package to build:

> networks commonly used in Economic Complexity to explore bipartite relations such as countries and their exported products. These methods are also useful for different kind of relations such as countries and their spoken languages.

In this post I use the built-in `ec_trade_1962` dataset to produce a proximity network, thanks to our heuristics to visualise large networks we can remove the cutoff points. 

```r
# remotes::install_github("pachamaltese/economiccomplexity")
library(economiccomplexity)

bi <- balassa_index(world_trade_avg_1998_to_2000)

pro <- proximity(bi)

net <- projections(pro$proximity_country, pro$proximity_product)
```

The `net$network_p` object is essentially an edgelist which we can thus simply pass to our initialisation function. Then of course we hide long edges to avoid drawing a hairball. I also use `graph_cluster` rather than color the links by coordinates which would not truly reveal clusters given the structure of the graph.

```r
library(grapher)

graph(net$network_product) %>% 
  graph_offline_layout(75) %>% 
  graph_cluster() %>% 
  scale_link_color(cluster, palette = graph_palette_light()) %>% 
  hide_long_links(100)
```
